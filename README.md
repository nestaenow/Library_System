Simple library system java application
## Introduction
Library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of a library (In this case a school library management system). The system helps both students and the library manager (librarian) to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the librarian and the student to search for a desired book.

The main feature of this system is that all the books available in the library can be displayed in a list so that students need not roam through the entire library to find a book. Additionally, the application effectively maintains the details of students to whom books have been issued.
In this system it is visualized in such a way that, at every main corridor leading to the various book shelfs, a screen and a keyboard are installed on which this application is installed and running. This is so that students could search for the available books present in the library without going through the librarian which will in turn safe time, for no one will roam through the library for hours to finally not even find the book they were looking for. 
For this system only the Librarian can record/register/delete books and Students. Preventing any mismatch of data and maintaining the integrity of the library's database.
The GUI of the system is made very user-friendly and quite beautiful, giving you more time reading your favourite book rather than wasting time looking for the book.

### Features as a student
Being a student, you can login into the system using your Full Names and your Matricule Number. Yes, it is as simple as spreading butter un a piece of bread. After you have logged in you have the possibility of searching for a book, by using either its Title or its ISBN.  Also, you get the possibility of listing all books present in the library's database. So basically, a student can do the following:
<li> Search a Book by its Title </li>
<li> Search a Book by its ISBN and </li>
<li> Display all books in the Library's database </li>

### Features as the librarian
On the other hand, the librarian being the administrator of the entire system will as a result perform lots of operations as compared to the student. Logging in as a librarian bring you a page where you can choose from the various options present. You could search for a book (by using its Title), search for a student record (by matricule). After results of this two are displayed from there you can delete a book/Student record.
Also, from your landing page after login you can record both books and students, and in turn eventually list your records. So basically, the librarian performs the following:
<li> Search a Book by its Title </li>
<li> Search a Book by its ISBN and </li>
<li> Display all books in the Library's database </li>
<li> Display all students in the Library's database </li>
<li> Record both books and students </li>
<li> Delete both books and students </li>
